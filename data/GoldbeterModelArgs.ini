# Goldbeter Model: use this file to change parameters for use with the model either simulated on a flat surface or a torus (use the Shell scripts runGoldbeterFlat.sh or runGoldbeterTorus.sh)

[Parameters]
diffusion = 0.12
beta = 0.4
surfaceWidth = 20
surfaceLength = 80	 				
waveLength = 0.2		
waveWidth = 0.5			
waveInside = 1				
outputTimestep = 5
tBoundary = 0	
tFinal = 4
xMesh = 100	
betaMin = 0
betaMax = 1

[System]
includeAllVars = 0
varyBeta = 0
justDiffusion = 0
icType = 2

# diffusion: Diffusion parameter - default is 0.12
# beta: Bifurcation parameter: oscillatory when 0.28895 < beta < 0.77427
# surfaceLength: Length of flat surface / major circumference of the surface (use 80 for weakly curved, 40 for strongly curved torus)
# surfaceWidth: Width of flat surface / minor circumference of the torus (always use 20 for torus)
# waveLength: Initial wave segment length as a percentage of total length of the surface (y/phi)
# waveWidth: Initial wave segment width as a percentage of total width of the surface (x/theta)
# waveInside: Bool for whether the initial wave is centered on the inside of the torus (true=1) or outside (false=0), not used for flat surface
# outputTimestep: Number of timesteps to output to file
# tBoundary: Time to turn off the absorbing boundary at y/phi = 0 (to eliminate backwards travelling waves) - set to 0 for no absorbing boundary
# tFinal: Time to run simulation
# xMesh: Mesh size in x/theta direction (yMesh is calculated from this value)
# betaMin: minimum value for beta when its spatially varied

# includeAllVars: 1 to include all variables on the torus, 0 to only include the main variable (for the Goldbeter model this is the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration Z) - to save time and memory
# varyBeta: 1 to spatially vary parameter beta linearly over the surface with beta in [0,1], 0 to keep beta constant
# justDiffusion: 1 to have no reaction terms in the system to simulate the diffusion equation, 0 for normal
# icType: 0 for homogeneous ICs, 1 for an initial perturbation, 2 for "random" ICs. Used only when varyBeta = 1.
