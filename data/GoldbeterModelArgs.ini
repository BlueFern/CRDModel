# diffusion: Diffusion parameter - default is 0.12
# beta: Bifurcation parameter, oscillatory when 0.28895 < beta < 0.77427
# surfaceLength: Length of flat surface or major circumference of the torus (use 80 for normal, 40 for more curved surface)
# surfaceWidth: Width of flat surface or minor circumference of the torus (use 20 for torus)
# waveLength: Initial wave segment length as a percentage of total length of torus (phi)
# waveWidth: Initial wave segment width as a percentage of total width of torus (theta)
# waveInside: Bool for whether the initial wave is centered on the inside of the torus (true=1) or outside (false=0), not used for flat surface
# outputTimestep: Number of timesteps to output to file
# tBoundary: Time to turn off the absorbing boundary at phi = 0 (to eliminate backwards travelling waves) - set to 0 for no absorbing boundary
# tFinal: Time to run simulation
# thetaMesh: Mesh size in theta direction

# includeAllVars: 1 to include all variables on the torus, 0 to only include the main variable (for the FHN model this is the activator variable u) - to save time and memory
# varyBeta: 1 to vary parameter beta over the torus with beta in [0,1], 0 to keep beta constant
# symmetricIC: 1 to have the initial perturbation as a rectangle centred on either the inside or outside of the torus, 0 to use an alternative initial perturbation specified in the C script
# justDiffusion: 1 to have no reaction terms in the system, 0 for normal
