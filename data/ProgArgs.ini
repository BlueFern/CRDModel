# beta: Bifurcation parameter - system is oscillatory for beta < 1, stable for beta > 1	
# majorCirc: Major circumference of the torus - use 80.0 for normal, 40.0 for more curved surface
# waveLength: Initial wave segment length as a percentage of total length of torus (phi)
# waveWidth: Initial wave segment width as a percentage of total width of torus (theta)
# waveInside: Bool for whether the initial wave is centered on the inside of the torus (true=1) or outside 		(false=0)
# outputTimestep: Number of timesteps to output to file
# tMax: Time to turn off the absorbing boundary at phi = 0 (to eliminate backwards travelling waves) - set 		to 0 for no absorbing boundary
# tFinal: Time to run simulation
# thetaMesh: Mesh size in theta direction
