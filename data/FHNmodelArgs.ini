[System]
includeAllVars = 1
varyBeta = 1

# beta: Bifurcation parameter - system is oscillatory for beta < 1, stable for beta > 1	
# majorCirc: Major circumference of the torus - use 80 for normal, 40 for more curved surface
# waveLength: Initial wave segment length as a percentage of total length of torus (phi)
# waveWidth: Initial wave segment width as a percentage of total width of torus (theta)
# waveInside: Bool for whether the initial wave is centered on the inside of the torus (true=1) or outside (false=0)
# outputTimestep: Number of timesteps to output to file
# tBoundary: Time to turn off the absorbing boundary at phi = 0 (to eliminate backwards travelling waves) - set to 0 for no absorbing boundary
# tFinal: Time to run simulation
# thetaMesh: Mesh size in theta direction

# includeAllVars: 1 to include all variables on the torus, 0 to only include the main variable (for the FHN model this is the activator variable u) - to save time and memory
# varyBeta: 1 to vary parameter beta over the torus with beta in [0.7,1.7], 0 to keep beta constant
